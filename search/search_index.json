Built on top of the popular Django and Flask frameworks, RevFrame provides a flexible and user-friendly environment for developers to create custom applications that can be easily deployed to the web. With RevFrame, researchers can seamlessly integrate their models into the application, allowing users to interact with the model through a user-friendly interface. The framework also provides an API that exposes endpoints to the model, making it easy for other applications to interact with the model as well. In addition to its powerful functionality, RevFrame also boasts a beautiful and intuitive UI that makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application. The framework also includes a built-in blog feature, allowing researchers to share updates and insights about their models with their users and the broader community. Whether you are a seasoned ML/AI/NLP researcher or just starting out, RevFrame is the perfect tool to help you bring your models to life on the web.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#revframe","text":"","title":"RevFrame"},{"location":"about/#_1","text":"RevFrame is a powerful web framework designed for ML/AI/NLP researchers who want to easily convert their models into web applications.

Set Up Docker : Install docker, following official documentation based on your operating system. Windows , Linux , MacOS To have a hassle free docker experience, we need docker compose , which is already installed if you install docker, Visit for more Python (Only if Python or PIP is not present in your system) Follow based on your OS Windows , Linux , MacOS How to Use Clone revframe - github link using git clone https://github.com/revanth-reddy/revframe.git cd revframe - Main Programming Language for this Framework docker compose up - To build and run the revframe. visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the application running. At http://127.0.0.1:8000/model you can input a sample word to generate a text and it can be seen in the output. How to use Custom Model or add your model to RevFrame Frontend/ # This the Frontend Folder. It features a django Application, you can customize frontend here ... # Other relevant pages, images and other files. Backend/ models/ # Folder that has the model related files, ***you need to make changes here*** model.py # You can modify this Model file *** ... # Other relevant pages, images and other files. docker-compose.yml # This is a docker compose file that spins up Frontend & Backend Containers Put your model that is ready for production or deployment inside model folder. In the model.py file make changes so that your model will be called using a command that is given inside os.system(''). For example model.py would utilize your model with a command similar to os.system('python image_detect.py --input_path=\"path/to/input_image\" --output_path=\"path/to/output_image\"') Verify the changes and now you can run the RevFrame with or without Docker. With Docker Now build the containers and restart using: docker compose build docker compose up Without Docker Frontend : Change your working directory to frontend . Inside frontend directory, Create a virtual environment using python -m venv myvenv . [If you don't have virtual environment, install it from the above Python Setup] Activate virtual environment using source myvenv/bin/activate . Now upgrade pip to the latest using pip install --upgrade pip Install necessary packages using pip install -r requirements.txt . Run frontend server using python manage.py runserver Backend In a new terminal open backend folder as your working directory. Inside backend directory, Create a virtual environment using python -m venv myvenv . Activate virtual environment using source myvenv/bin/activate . Now upgrade pip to the latest using pip install --upgrade pip Install necessary packages using pip install -r requirements.txt . Add your model requirements to requirements.txt Make changes to app.py and model.py if necessary to accomodate the new model that has been added. Run backend server using flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001 Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the frontend server's homepage.
